# MusicPlayer üéß

This project is created by the DLSUD students of ICT-22. This application allows you to play music locally by dragging and dropping the mp3/wav file into the specified GUI location. This then grabs it's path file, with the path file, we play the music through built-in Java libraries. The application utilizes "Swing" which is a GUI toolkit for Java. It is going to be utilizing buttons, labels and etc. Mainly, the buttons are going to be used to play, pause and reset the current mp3/wav file.

## How to use/run the program

Our program is composed of 4 main components.

- Dropbox üì¶
  The dropbox is responsible for selecting the audio file that is going to be played. Once a audio file is dragged into the specified       location (namely, where it says "Drag an audio file here!"), only then you are able to press the buttons below without getting an         error.
  
- Play Button ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
  This button is responsible for playing the audio file. 
  
- Pause Button ‚è∏Ô∏è
  This button is responsible for pausing the current playing audio file. 

- Reset Button ‚èπÔ∏è
  This button is responsible for removing the current audio file if you do wish to drag a new audio file.
  
‚ùóNOTE: clicking all of these buttons would give an error if you have not dropped an audio file into the program.

To use/run our program, you will see a space where you can drag audio files, buttons such as, play, pause and reset. In the event you click one of these buttons without dragging a audio file, a pop-up will appear claiming there is no audio file ongoing. There are currently two audio files you can enter, WAV and MP3. For a case you drag a WAV audio file, a volume button will appear. It simply pops up a new JFrame with a slider where in you can change the volume of the current audio file. Once you click play, a duration of the current audio file will appear. However, in a case of using an MP3 file, both the volume and duration won't appear as it is not supported by our third party library JACO MP3 player.
