## MusicPlayer 

### Description
- This project is created by the DLSUD students of ICT-22. This application allows you to play music locally by dragging and dropping the mp3/wav file into the specified GUI location. This then grabs it's path file, with the path file, we play the music through built-in Java libraries. The application utilizes "Swing" which is a GUI toolkit for Java. It is going to be utilizing buttons, labels and etc. Mainly, the buttons are going to be used to play, pause and reset the current mp3/wav file.

### Reason of Project Choice
- Because we love music and we want to make a Java program based on what we love. We think this is important because it motivates us to make sure this works out in the end.
